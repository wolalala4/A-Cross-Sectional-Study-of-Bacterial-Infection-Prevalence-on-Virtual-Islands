# A-Cross-Sectional-Study-of-Bacterial-Infection-Prevalence-on-Virtual-Islands
In this study, our objective was to determine whether there’s a difference in the prevalence of people who have bacterial infections among the three islands. Our investigators thought the different locations could play an important role in the distribution of the disease because the climate could be different. We performed a Chi-Square test for homogeneity and proved that the location did influence the prevalence of people with bacterial infections. And through a logistic model, we found that the ‘age’ covariate also had a significant influence on the result while the other covariate ‘gender’ did not.
